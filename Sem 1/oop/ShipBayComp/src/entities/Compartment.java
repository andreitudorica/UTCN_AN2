/**
 * Created by Andrei on 13/01/2017.
 * Compartment:
 * Has a final ID (UUID - String) generated at construction time
 * Can be a passenger or cargo type
 * Both passenger and cargo compartments will contain a collection of Carriable objects
 * Can compute its profit based on the total profit of all items (or people) it is carrying
 * Passenger compartments have a fixed price of 100 and thus their profit are calculated based on how many passenger they have inside  (price * number of carriable objects in it)
 * Passenger compartments can hold a maximum of 100 passengers and this restriction has to be imposed when adding a passenger
 * Cargo compartments contain a CargoItem. The profit is calculated by multiplying the number of carriable items inside the compartment times the CargoItemsâ€™s profit. (each cargo compartment has only one CargoItem but of course, many carriables)
 * Passenger ticket price is a constant
 * Max number of passengers is also a constant
